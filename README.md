# <Get'Er Done Planner>

## Description

The Get"Er Done Planner is the all-in-one for any busy student with a need and want to have an overall view of their month as well as a daily weather forecast.

We wanted to make a calendar with the ability to add events to stay up to date with homework, projects, and other daily events.

Throughout this project, we learned how to more efficiently troubleshoot, implement third party API's, CSS framework (other than Bootstrap) and worked as a team.

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repo and your troubles are over.
